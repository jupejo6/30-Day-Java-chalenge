# 30 day Java chalenge

In this repository, I finished every day of the "30 Day Challenge" from hackerrank.com, 
using only my (freshly acquired) knowledge and some Java tutorial websites.

When HackerRank didn't fully accept my code, I added some unit tests because HackerRank only provided the expected output, 
not my actual (and in some cases incorrect) one.

All the 30 challenges were accepted by HackerRank, and I am the proud owner of my 5 Star Gold Medal.
