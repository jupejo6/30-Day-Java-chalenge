#30 day Java chalenge

In this repository i finished every days of the "30 Day Challenge" from hackerrank.com, 
using only my (freshly aquired) knowledge and some java tutorial websites.

Sometimes my code wasnt fully accepted by hackerrank, so i made some unit tests, since hacker Rank provided only the necessary output, without my actual (in thoose cases wrong) one.


All the 30 chalenges were accepted by hackerrank, im a proud owner of my 5 Star Gold medal. :)
